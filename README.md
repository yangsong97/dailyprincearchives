Textual Analysis of Daily Princetonian Archives

Adviser: Dr. Brian Kernighan

Abstract:

This project studies Daily Princetonian archives from 1946 to 2015, quantitatively analyzing the text within articles to examine Princeton’s history through a linguistic lens. Using several word embedding models including Word2Vec, this project explores the relationships between words, capturing word similarity and association, as well as the change in usage of words over time.
Visualization tools of relative frequency counts for words and phrases are also created. This project extends several earlier projects that perform textual analysis of the Daily Princetonian archives which instead focus on n-grams and sentence-level sentiment analysis, by using a word vector approach to analyze the relationships between individual words from a Princeton perspective. Using word vectors allows us to determine analogies between words, as well as semantic similarity. We examine several natural language processing models and compare their effectiveness for textual analysis and data visualization. This project builds upon efforts to digitize the Daily Princetonian archive through applying modern tools in natural language processing to analyze the text from articles and visualize data describing trends throughout Princeton’s history. Through focusing on newspapers from the last seven decades, we can observe how major events, including the admittance of women to Princeton’s campus, protests against the Vietnam War and changes to Princeton’s Eating Club admittance are represented through language. The results and visualizations reflect Princeton’s cultural, historical and linguistic change throughout time and can be used by future scholars, researchers and historians.
